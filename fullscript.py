in a strange abyss, the keychain around his neck waving in the current 
of wind blowing upwards. Gold letters appear in the void)""")

for real or not?""")
    print("""(The words fade away. The boy's heart pumps as he falls deeper into the 
abyss, his eyes closed. The empty nothingness becomes water, and bubbles 
form in the wake of his descent. He reaches a barrier and his eyes blink 
open with a flash. He finds himself standing on a sandy beach on a clear 
sunny day. He looks around and sees another boy in the water. Holding his 
hand up to block the glare of the sun, he steps toward the boy in the water 
to get a closer look. Suddenly, the ocean waters recede. He looks up and 
gasps. The boy in the water, turns his head, the breeze billowing through 
his silver hair, as a wave forms beyond. He smirks, holding his hand out 
as the wave reaches its pinnacle behind him. The boy with brown hair runs 
toward the boy in the water, who isn't moving. Time seems to slow down as 
the wave crashes down on top of them. The first boy spins in the water, 
gritting his teeth. He rights himself and stares at the other boy, who is 
unfazed, saying nothing with his arm beckoning. The first boy tries to 
reach him, but is swept away with the current. He eventually surfaces, 
gasping for air, the water dripping off of him as the sun hangs low in 
the sky. He sees a girl on the shore waving to him and calling his name. 
He waves back and starts padding towards shore as she bounces happily on 
her feet. The girl stands with her hands behind her back as he arrives. He 
bends down slightly, catching his breath and smirks up at her. She giggles 
until something in the sky catches her attention, her face forming a 
serious look. He stands up and turns around. A meteor shower rains down 
from the sky, a shadowy figure among them. They stare in awe, and the 
boy realizes the figure is himself. He gasps and feels himself falling. 
He becomes the figure in the sky as he falls below the girl, reaching out 
to her. She reaches out to him until the image of her ripples in water 
reflecting the sky. The boy falls back, eyes closed, sinking deeper as 
bubbles trail him. He stirs awake and manages to right himself before 
settling onto a dark platform. He looks around and takes a step forward. 
There is a flash of blinding light as a large flock of birds rise from 
the platform, flying in all directions and scattering feathers everywhere. 
The boy shields his eyes as the wind whips at him. He watches them leave 
while the last feathers fall. The platform now depicts a girl taking a 
bite out of an apple. The boy turns around seeing no one, yet hearing a voice)""")

The door is still shut. Now, step forward. Can you do it?""")

and magic. The boy turns toward it. A red shield blinks into existence, 
floating above it)""")
